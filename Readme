- Includes database schemas for users, tasks, and roles.
- Uses an ORM/ODM like Sequelize, TypeORM, or Mongoose.

### Error Handling
- Consistent error handling for invalid inputs and unauthorized actions.

### Testing
- Unit and integration tests written using Jest/Mocha.

### Deployment
- Includes a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup.
- Deployment instructions provided.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn (latest stable version)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB (if using a database)

## 1. Start the Node.js Server

### Steps:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the necessary configurations, such as:

   ```env
   PORT=8080
   DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   JWT_EXPIRE=<your-jwt-time>
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. The server will start on the specified port (default: 8080).

   Example:

   ```
   Server running at http://localhost:8080
   ```

## 2. Run Test Cases

### Steps:

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

## 3. Run Docker Compose

### Steps:

1. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Verify that the containers are running. The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:<PORT>`.

3. To stop the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
